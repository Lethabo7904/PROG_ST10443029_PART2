>The application will firstly play the welcome audio saying "Welcome to the cybersecurity awareness chatbot. I'll help you stay safe online."

> After the welcome audio, a cybersecurity logo will be displayed using ascii images.

> A welcome message written "Welcome to the cybersecurity awareness ChatBot", which is in the center will be displayed.

> The chatbot will prompt the user to enter their name to initiate a conversation.

> I designed the code in a way that the user can only ask the chatbot questions related to cybersecurity, and if the user asks the chatbot outside the related questions the chatbot should reply with " I am sorry I do not have the answer to that question, please ask questions that are cybersecurity related :(!!!");".

> The user can only ask questions like "What is phishing", "What is malware", and "How to create a strong password".

> If the user has no further question they can type "Exit" and press enter to exit the chat.

> After pressing enter the chatbot will respond with "Goodbye. Remember to stay safe online." 

>Overall Program Flow:
User is greeted and prompted to enter their name.

The chatbot enters a continuous chat loop (do...while) where it:

Reads user input.

Cleans unnecessary words (e.g., "please", "can", "tell").

Detects if the user expresses sentiments like "worried", "curious", or "frustrated".

Remembers the user's favorite cybersecurity topic if mentioned (e.g., "privacy", "password").

Responds using:

Predefined exact responses.

Topic-based arrays (phishing, password safety, malware).

Keyword-based random responses.

Handles unknown inputs gracefully with fallback responses and personalized tips using remembered topics.

User can exit the chat by typing "exit".
